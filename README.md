# CV_English
My CV in English written in Latex

## Tools needed
I am using right now Visual Studio Code with Latex Workshop extension to compile my CV pdf. These are the tools needed to make the compilation work:
- MikTex (or anoter latex distribution like TexLive)
- Strawberry Perl (for Windows, maybe for Linux is not needed)
- Visual Studio Code + Latex Workshop plugin (if you don't want to user other Latex clients like Texworks)

Check the following video if it is still available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyHIQl4VM8


## Compiler
Use lualatex compiler to compile main.tex. Other compilers like pdflatex or xelatex cannot use fontspec library
